# Installing ROOT via conda

Currently the following ROOT binaries with Python support are provided for the following versions in the `main` channel: 

|   | ROOT | ROOT |
| ---| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Python**| 2.7 / 5.34.32 | 3.4 / 5.34.32 |
| **Python** | 2.7 / 6.04  | 3.4 / 6.04 |


To install ROOT in your conda environment, decide upon the ROOT and Python version you plan to use. **We discourage** installing everything in your default conda (*root*) environment, and rather creating a separate one. For example:

```
$ conda create --name=testenv root=6 python=3
$ source activate testenv
```
This will install ROOT6 and Python3 and all dependencies to make things work.

Test if ROOT works like it should:

```
$ root -b -q

>>> import ROOT
>>> f = ROOT.TFile.Open("test.root","recreate")
```

If you have other channels in your conda configuration (besides the defaults one), make sure that the following packages are picked up from the right one (NLeSC) when you create the new environment.

You may need to set:
``` 
$ conda config --set show_channel_urls yes 
```
in order to see the channels from which the binaries are installed.
